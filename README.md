Demo Git, GitHub and RStudio

### Setup

We'll be working with Git + GitHub + RStudio. This truly requires your attention before our meeting. I want to show you how to use Git/GitHub in your life as an R-using data analyst, which means we can't afford to get bogged down in a hot mess of Git installation issues. Let's try to work through them beforehand.

Why Git/GitHub

If you wonder why Git/GitHub are useful, you might want to read Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?  (https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)
